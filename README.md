# STHEM

The public release of the TULIPP utilities for efficient development of embedded high-performance image processing applications.

All information is found in the [wiki](https://github.com/tulipp-eu/sthem/wiki).

If you use STHEM for a publication, we would appreciate if you cite our ARC'18 paper:

*["Supporting Utilities for Heterogeneous Embedded Image Processing Platforms (STHEM): An Overview"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78890-6_59)*, Ahmad Sadek, Ananya Muddukrishna, Lester Kalms, Asbj√∏rn Djupdal, Ariel Podlubne, Diana Goehringer and Magnus Jahre, *In Proc. of the International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing (ARC)*, 2018.

Note that these utilities have been replaced by the Lynsyn host software.  If possible you should use the Lynsyn host software instead of the STHEM tools.  The Lynsyn host software can be found here:
