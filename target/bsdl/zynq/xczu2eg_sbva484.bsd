--
-- This BSDL file reflects the pre-configuration JTAG behavior. To reflect
-- the post-configuration JTAG behavior (if any), edit this file as described
-- below. Many of these changes are demonstrated by commented-out template
-- lines preceding the lines they would replace:
--
-- 1. Enable USER instructions as appropriate (see below).
-- 2. Set disable result of all pads as configured.
-- 3. Set safe state of boundary cells as necessary.
-- 4. Rename entity if necessary to avoid name collisions.
-- 5. Modify USERCODE value in USERCODE_REGISTER declaration.
--
-- To prevent losing the current configuration, the boundary scan
-- test vectors should keep the PS_PROG_B pin High.
--
-- PS_PROG_B can only be captured, not updated.  The value
-- at the pin is always used by the device.
--
-- All IOBs prior to configuration, and unused and output-only IOBs following
-- configuration, will sense their pad values during boundary-scan with a CMOS
-- input buffer. In order to properly capture a logic High value at one
-- of these IOBs into its input boundary scan cell, please refer to the
-- data sheet and user guide for proper input levels.
--
-- For post-configuration boundary scan only: If an IOB is configured to use
-- an input standard that uses VREF pins, then the boundary scan test vectors
-- must keep the used VREF pins 3-stated.
